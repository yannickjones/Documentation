# DevOps Platform Releases
>Release Management is an important aspect of delivering new features, enhancements and bug fixes. We consider DevOps Platform as a true product thats used by all of our Product teams and as a result we follow proper release management processes.

Our Release strategy is based on a very simple model:
>Deliver usable features in to the platform as quickly as possible.

As a result, we continuously deploy new features, fixes and enhancements on demand. But we perform an official release ceremony on third Tuesday of every month.
